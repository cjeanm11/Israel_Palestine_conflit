# Timeline

## Mid 1919 - July 1922 - [The Mandate for Palestine](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp)
- Civil administration began in Palestine and Transjordan in July 1920 and April 1921, respectively, and the mandate was in force from September 29, 1923 to May 15, 1948 and to May 25, 1946 respectively.
- The White Paper of 1939 enacted until the end of British Mandated rule
  - Called for the establishment of a Jewish national home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years.
  - Limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for five years, and allowed Arab majority to determine future Jewish immigration.
  - Jews were restricted from buying Arab land in all but 5% of the Mandate.
  - The Palestinian Arab parties, acting under Haj Amin Effendi al-Husseini, rejected this proposal, but probably should have accepted.
  - The Arab counter offer wanted independence, no Jewish national home in Palestine, replacement of the Mandate by a treaty, and the end of Jewish immigration

## 1936-1939 - Arab revolt in Palestine
- Popular uprising by Palestinian Arabs in Mandatory Palestine against British mandate due to increasing flow of Jewish immigrants.
- Sparked by back and forth killings of two Jews by a Qassamite band, followed by the retaliatory killing of two Arab workers
- First part of movement was seized upon by the urban and elitist Arab Higher Committee which made the revolt focus on strikes and other political forms of protest
- Second phase in 1937 led to violent conflict between British Army and Palestine Police force against the peasant-led resistance movement
- Walid Khalidi estimates 19,792 casualties for the Arabs, with 5,032 dead, 3,832 killed by the British and 1,200 dead due to intracommunal terrorism, and 14,760 wounded. Several hundred Palestinian Jews were killed.

## The Peel Commission
- Published on July 7, 1937
- First time declaration that Mandatory Palestine was becoming unworkable and needed to be partitioned

## 1944-1948 - Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine
- The Haganah, Irgun, Lehi all joined together to form the Jewish Resistance Movement.
- Insurgent activities in the area were in response to the proposed 1939 White Paper.
- On the 22nd of July, 1946, the Irgun bombed the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, leading to the deaths of 91 people of various nationalities. This hotel was the headquarters for Mandatory Palestine.
  - Was the deadliest attack against the British during the entire Mandate era (1920-1948)
- November 29th, 1947 - [The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, or Resolution 181](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/res181.asp)
  - A four-part document, the Partition Plan, was attached, that provided for the termination of the Mandate, the withdrawal of British armed forces, and the [delineation of boundaries] between the two states and Jerusalem.
  - The Arab Higher Committee and the Arab League rejected this proposal due to the fact that 56% of the land would be allocated to the Jewish state, despite the Palestinian Arab population numbering twice that of the Jewish population. The Jewish Agency for Palestine and most Zionist factions accepted.

## 1948 Palestine War
- Known to Israel as the War of Independence, and to the Palestinians as the Nakba
- Israel declares [independence](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/general/declaration-of-establishment-state-of-israel) at Tel Aviv on May 14th, 1948.
- War had two main phases, the first began on November 30th, 1947.
  - First phase mainly fought between Jewish and Palestinian Arab militias, supported by the Arab Liberation Army and the surrounding Arab states. Escalated at the end of March 1948, when Jews went on the offensive.
- After Arabs fled Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, the US pulled out of the Partition Plan while the British supported the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.
- Funds raised by Golda Meir and Stalin's support allowed Israel to purchase weapons from Eastern Europe.
- May 14th, 1948, the last British troops and personnel departed Haifa, and the Jewish leadership declared the establishment of the state of Israel.
- Second phase of the war began in May of 1948, the Arab-Israeli War, when invasion happens after Jewish leadership declares independence.
  - Invading countries were Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan and Syria, supported by the Arab Liberation Army and corps of volunteers from Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Yemen
- Plan Dalet
  - Forced expulsion and control of areas that extended beyond the proposed partition borders. Some (Zionists) claim that this was a defensive action to secure the future safety and borders of the new country, Israel, others claim this was purely an offensive territorial conquest aimed to ethnically cleanse the surrounding lands of Arabs to make it fertile for future Jews to settle.
- In 1949, Israel signed separate Armistice agreements with Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria to establish [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements#/media/File:Palestine_Military_Situation,_April_6,_1949,_Truman_Papers.jpg) temporary military borders.
  - Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip and had a demilitarized zone around 'Uja al-Hafeer.
  - Lebanon agreed to international boundary between Lebanon and Mandatory Palestine.
  - Jordanian forces remained in East Jerusalem and other positions held by them.
    - Also allowed to take over positions previously held by Iraqi forces.
  - Syria maintained 66 square kilometers in the Jordan Valley, designated as DMZs.
  - Iraq had no formal agreement as they withdrew their forces.
  - The new military borders, as set by the agreements, encompassed about 78% of Mandatory Palestine.
- Israel lost 6,373 people (4,000 soldiers), about 1% of its population. The exact number of Arab losses is estimated between 4,000 and 15,000.
- Over 700,000 displaced Palestinians that fled or were expelled from their land as a result. Over 700,000 Jews exodus from Arab and Muslim lands in the 3 years following the war, fleeing into Israel.
- Established Israel as an independent state (founded by David Ben-Gurion), recognized immediately by Truman (U.S.) and Stalin (USSR).

- May 11th, 1949 - Israel admitted as a member of the United Nations
- Over the next few years, lots of Jews (over 700,000) came from all over the Middle East/world to live in Israel.

## October 29th, 1956-November 7th, 1956 - The Second Arab-Israeli War, or the Suez Crisis
- Lead-up
  - Suez Canal Company formed in 1858 by French Ferdinand de Lesseps to build the Suez Canal from 1859 to 1869, opening on 1869 to allow trade.
  - Baghdad Pact in 1955, created compromising Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and the United Kingdom
  - Tripartite Declaration was a way for the US, France and the UK to limit the amount of arms sales in the Middle East, hopefully preventing an arms race.
  - Egypt was responsible for establishing multiple Palestinian fedayeen camps inside Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon.
  - Israel was willing to work with Egypt in direct negotiations in 1956, regardless of Egypt's aggressive demand to resettle Palestinian refugees and the annexation of the southern half of Israel.
  - Nasser (leader of Egypt) built reputation of extreme anti-Zionism in attempt to unify and be the leader of the Arab states.
- On July 26th, 1956, Nasser nationalized and purchased all assets of the Suez Canal Company, closed the canal to Israeli shipping, closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba.
  - Contravention of the Constantinople Convention of 1888 and most likely a violation of the 1949 Armistice Agreements.
- Different countries had different positions on what to do
  - Eden from Great Britain wanted war, though opposition parties cautioned that doing so without UN approval would not be supported.
  - Guy Mollet from France and the rest of the nation was eager for military action.
  - Eisenhower from DC did not really care.
  - Canada didn't care.
  - Australia kind of cared.
  - New Zealand cared.
- Initial proposal would have allowed Egyptian "sovereignty" to be recognized while maintaining an international operation of the Canal. Nasser rejected.
- British and French hungry for military intervention to solve potential Canal problems, despite Eisenhower's disapproval.
- Israel was interested in partaking in military conflicts.
  - Israel's interest in war was weakening a hostile state. Egypt-held Gaza Strip (+surrounding countries, via Egyptian supported Palestinian Fedayeen) was responsible for attacks injuring approximately 1,300 civilians.
  - Israel was also scared about Egypt's large procurement of weapons, and feared they'd forged a secret alliance with Jordan and Syria.
  - Ben-Gurion's "grand plan" involved Israel taking territory north into Lebanon, having the West Bank run as a semi-autonomous state attached to Israel, and having Iraq claim everything on the East Bank because Israel believed Jordan to be an unstable state. They also encouraged the taking of the Sinai Peninsula.
  - The Protocol of Sèvres was agreed to by Israel, France and the UK.
  - On October 29, Israel would invade the Sinai.
  - October 30, Anglo-French ultimatum to demand both sides withdraw from canal zone.
  - October 31, Britain and France would begin Revise.
- The Kafr Qasim Massacre
  - Took place in Israeli-Arab village of Kafr Qasim during the war, where Israel Border Police illegally killed Arab civilians returning from work during a curfew they were unaware of. 48 people died.
  - The border policemen who were involved in the shooting were trialed and jailed for 7-17 years.
  - All sentences were later reduced, with some of the convicted receiving presidential pardons
  - Every convicted person was eventually released by November 1959
- Total Casualties
  - British 22 dead, 96 wounded
  - French 10 dead, 33 wounded
  - Israel 172 dead, 817 wounded
  - Egypt 1,500-3,500 dead, 4,900 wounded with 1,000 Egyptian civilians estimated dead
- International Reaction
  - Eisenhower was very upset with Israel/Britain/France, because the US could not reasonably oppose Soviet actions in Hungary while remaining silent on European plans to seize territory from Egypt
  - 300,000 protestors in Pakistan chanting anti-British slogans
  - Syrian government blew up the IPC pipeline to punish Iraq and Britain
  - Saudi Arabia imposed a oil embargo on Britain and France
  - US calls for security council and UN meetings/resolutions
    - Resolution 997, a call for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces behind the armistice lines, an arms embargo and the reopening of the Suez Canal. Which was currently blocked. Passes with a vote of 64-5
  - West Germany was furious with the US and supported France and Britain
  - Israel originally wanted to maintain indefinite control over the Sinai, but was eventually forced out due to international pressure led heavily by Eisenhower.
- November 6, 1956 - British announced a ceasefire
- Anglo-French task force was fully withdrawn by December 22, 1956
- Israeli forces were fully withdrawn from the Sinai and Gaza in March of 1957 after destroying and stealing Egyptian infrastructure and villages on the way out
- Eisenhower asked congress for authorization to use military force and set aside $200M to help middle eastern countries that desired aid from the US
- The Soviet Union was given all the credit due to nuclear saber-rattling from Nasser, though it was almost assuredly US diplomatic and financial pressure that brought the conflict to a swift end
- Jews had their civil liberties infringed upon in Egypt following the war, resulting in some 25,000 (almost half) of the Jewish population leaving Egypt
- **Final Summary**
  - In 1956 Egyptian leader Nasser, driven by his desire to be neither a puppet to the US nor USSR, nationalized the Suez canal (in defiance of the Constantinople Convention of 1888) while simultaneously acquiring large amounts of weapons from the USSR. Worried that trade would be interrupted, Britain and France approached Israel, who was worried that the anti-Zionist Egypt was amassing a massive military, to devise a covert plan, the Protocol of Sèvres, in order to stage an Israeli military invasion that would be disrupted by Anglo-Franco forces, which would then give way to an international ownership of the Suez Canal. Despite military success by all three parties, intense international pressure, especially from the United States, pressure from revolting colonies, and intense domestic pressure at home, combined with nuclear saber-rattling from the USSR, forced the Anglo-Franco forces to immediately withdraw, suffering an international humiliation. Israel would withdraw its forces sometime later, having re-established trade through the Straights of Tiran. Egypt, and namely, Nasser, would emerge feeling as though they had single-handedly defied European imperialistic aims, and saw itself as an emerging unaligned leader of the Arab World.

## 1963-1969 - Eshkol
- In 1964, Egypt, Jordan and Syria developed a unified military command.
- Israel completely work on a national water carrier, Arabs responded by attempting to divert the headwaters of Jordan, leading to growing conflict between Israel and Syria
- Until 1966, Israel's weapons came from France, though Charles de Gaulle ceased supplying Israel with arms post-Algerian withdrawal. The US stepped in to replace the flow of weapons.

## June 5, 1967 - The Six-Day War, or the Third Arab-Israeli War
- Summary
  - May 1967, Nasser mobilizes Egyptian military into defensive lines along the Israeli border and closes the shipping lanes through the Straits of Tiran to Israeli vessels, despite Israel warning this would be a casus belli. Nasser also orders the removal of all UNEF personnel.
  - Israel would capture the Sinai Peninsula, the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.

  - PLO activity and attacks against Israel from Arab countries continued.
  - In May 1967, Nasser received bogus intel from the USSR that Israel was massing on the Syrian border, so he gathered troops in the Sinai Peninsula, ejected UNEF personnel, and once again denied passage of Israeli vessels through the Straits of Tiran.
  - On the 30th of May, Jordan an Egypt signed a defense pact. Iraq and Egypt began deploying troops and armored units in Jordan.
  - The United States did not believe at the time that Egypt was preparing for an offensive war against Israel, as per the Watch Committee.
  - Nasser's speech towards the Arab Trade Unionists in May 26th, 1967, claimed "The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel."

- Noteworthy Battle Things
  - Surprise attack on Egyptian airfield guaranteed all but certain victory in the Sinai for Israel.
  - IDF originally was to avoid Gaza Strip/city, but attacks from that area forced the IDF to take over that territory
  - Jordanian Army was instructed to lay a two-hour barrage against military and civilian settlements in central Israel itself
  - Eshkol promised Israel would not initiate any action against Jordan if it stayed out of the way, but King Hussein refused.
  - Jordanian shelling of Jerusalem resulted in 20 dead and 1,000 wounded civilians
  - Dayan ordered troops not to capture the Old City due to potential international backlash plus potential outrage of being forced to give back holy sites that capturing them. After hearing about the impending UN ceasefire, he changed his mind and captured it.
  - "Fearful that Israeli soldiers would exact retribution for the 1929 massacre of the city's Jewish community, Hebron's residents flew white sheets from their windows and rooftops."
  - Syria entered the war on the assumption that Israel was losing dramatically to Egyptian forces. Nasser exaggerated/lied about Egyptian victory.
  - Dayan, after hearing of the Syrian acceptance of a ceasefire, clears an invasion/occupation on his own into the Golan Heights.
- Conclusion
  - Israel seizes the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula (from Egypt), the West Bank of the Jordan River, including East Jerusalem (from Jordan), and the Golan Heights (from Syria).

- In August of 1970, Israel, Jordan and Egypt agreed to an "in place" ceasefire under the Rogers Plan, though Egyptians and Soviet allies violated the agreement shortly thereafter.

## Battle of Karameh
- 1968 Battle of Karameh involved IDF forces crossing into Jordan to attack Karameh and the village of Safi, purportedly to eliminate PLO forces and fedayeen camps staging attacks against Israel, and to capture Yasser Arafat, including a school bus full of children running into a mine.
- Israel dropped leaflets to warn the Jordanian army not to intervene, but Jordan decided to assist the PLO regardless.
- In the aftermath, though Israel had achieved its tactical aims, they came at international political cost, with the US condemning Israel's actions.
- Nearly 20,000 fedayeen in Jordan due to surging recruits after the psychological victory over the IDF.
- Iraq and Syria offered training programs for several thousand guerillas, the Persian Gulf States and Kuwait raised money through taxes on Palestinian workers, and a fund drive in Lebanon raised $500,000 from Beirut alone.

## 1969 - The Cairo Agreement
- Gave the PLO a free hand to attack Israel from South Lebanon.

## October 1st, 1970 - Black September, or the Jordanian Civil War
- Background
  - Jordans population right now consisted of 2/3 of Palestinians, and only 1/3 of Jordanians. Nasser's political support also strengthened the Palestinians position.
  - Palestinian fedayeen enclaves in Jordan began to set up "independent republics" where they attempted to set up checkpoints and tax citizens.
  - In September 1970, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked four airliners bound for New York City and one for London. Explosives were used to destroy the empty planes for the press.
  - King Hussein say this as the last straw, and threat to his rule, and decided to take action against the PLO presence in Jordan.
  - Jordan allowed the fedayeen to relocate to Lebanon via Syria, where four years later they would become involved in the Lebanese Civil War.
  - The Palestinian Black September Organization was founded afterwards to punish Jordan for its expulsion, resulting in the assassination of Jordanian prime minister Wasfi Tal in 1971 due to his command of the military during operations against the fedayeen.
    - This organization also carried out a terrorist attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, with 8 members killing 11 Israeli coaches and athletes, as well as one West German police officer.
- By 1970, different factions within the PLO called for the overthrow of Jordan's king, Hussein.
- Hussein attempted to appease the fedayeen with an edict, and with the support of Nasser, though this failed and the fedayeen continued to grow in opposition. Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait openly supported the fedayeen.
- Israel guaranteed Jordan that they would not push territorial boundaries if Jordan withdraw troops from the border for a PLO confrontation.
- On the 7th of June, Hussein's motorcade came under heavy fire by fedayeen soldiers while attempting to visit the *mukhabarat* headquarters.

  - In October of 1972, facing mounting domestic pressure, Sadat declared his intention to go to war against Israel, even absent Soviet support.
  - In February of 1973, Sadat made a final peace overture towards Israel via Kissinger, which Meir rejected, most likely with the understanding that war was invetiable.
  - Israel did not think war was coming, despite multiple repeated credible warnings, including a warning from King Hussein himself.
- Israeli Preparation
  - Meir, the Chief of General Staff, opted not to attack Syria hours before the war began because he recognized the importance for not being blamed as starting any order to recruit American or other international assistance.

- Participation by other states
  - The US intelligence community, including the CIA, failed to predict the Egyptian-Syrian attack on Israel.
  - Most officials in the Defense and State Departments opposed financing Israel, but Kissinger argued heavily in favor of supporting Israel so they would confirm to American views in postwar diplomacy.
  - Meir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton-TNT tactical nuclear weapons for Jericho missiles, done in an easily detectable way to signal to the United States.
  - On the 9th of October, after Kissinger learned of the nuclear alert, Nixon ordered the beginning of Operation Nickel Grass.
    - The US, over 32 days, airlifted 22,325 tons of tanks, artillery and ammunition to Israel.

## December 8th, 1987 - September 13th, 1993 - The first Palestinian Intifada
- General Causes
  - Israel opened up low and semi-skilled labor markets to Palestinians in occupied territory. By the time of the Intifada, over 40% of Palestinian workers were working in Israel daily.
  - Palestinian populations were growing, but work and other opportunities were heavily restricted in the occupied territories
  - The Jewish settler population in the West Bank grew from 35,000 in 1984 to 130,000 by the mid 1990s
  - The occupied Palestinians likely felt themselves humiliated in a variety of ways as indefinite occupation by Israel continued
- Background
  - Two potential causes that sparked the Intifada
    - The truck incident in which four Palestinians were killed by an Israel truck crashing into them
    - The IDF failure in late November 1987 to stop a Palestinian guerilla operation, the Night of the Gliders, in which six Israeli soldiers were killed
  - Mass demonstrations occurred a year earlier after two Gaza students were shot by Israeli soldiers on campus on December 4, 1986
  - The Arab summit in Amman in November 1987 focuses heavily on the Iran-Iraq war, sidelining the Palestinian issue for the first time in years
- Leadership and Aims
  - The Intifada was mainly led by independent community councils and advocated for a non-violent approach so that the Palestinians would not lose support from liberal Israelis
  - For the first time, Palestinians are calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, notable departing from the standard rhetorical calls for the "liberation" of all of Palestine
- The Intifada
  - Israel had assumed that its oppressive actions against the Palestinians would cause their resistance to collapse early, though this was a mistaken assumption
  - On December 8, 1987, and Israeli army tank transporter crashed into a row of cars, killing four Palestinians. They were residents of the Jabalya refugee camp, the largest of the eight refugee camps in the Gaza Strip. Seven others were seriously injured.
  - Assumptions about the crash led to demonstrations, which caused back and forth violence between Israelis and Palestinians
  - In the beginning of the Intifada, no Israeli settlements were attacked nor were there any Israeli fatalities
  - The IDF used every crowd control measure available, though disturbances continued to gain momentum
  - Israel engaged in mass arrests and the closure of Palestinian schools and businesses, utilities and confinement to homes, as well as damage to farms and blockage from selling agricultural produce. Settlers also engaged in private violence against Palestinians.
- Casualties
  - ~1,200 Palestinians killed, 57K-120K arrested, 481 deported, 2,532 houses destroyed.
  - 179-200 Israelis killed, 3,100 Israelis (1,700 soldiers vs 1,400 civilians) suffered injuries
  - Between 1988 and 1992, intra-Palestinian violence claimed the lives of nearly 1,000, mainly due to the PLO killings of suspected collaborators
- Foreign Reaction
  - The UN (including the US) drafted a resolution condemning alleged Israeli violations of human rights. Israel declared it would not abide by SCR672 because it did not pay attention to attacks on Jewish worshippers. Israel also blocked a delegation of the Secretary-General for investigating Israeli violence
- Outcomes
  - The Intifada broke the image of Jerusalem as a united city, and the increase in international coverage as heavily critical of Israel
  - Arafat and his followers moderated their political programme; at the meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers in November of 1988, Arafat won a majority for the historic decision to recognize Israel's legitimacy, to accept all relevant UN resolutions going back to November 29, 1947, and to adopt the principle of a two-state solution
  - Arafat's support for Saddam Hussein's invasion into Kuwait essentially led to a mass exodus of 300,000+ Palestinians fleeing Kuwait, mostly to return to Jordan. It also led to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia cutting off financial support to the PLO

- Hosted by Spain and co-sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union
  - Involved Israel and the Palestinians, as well as Arab countries, including Jordan, Lebanon and Syria

  - Shamir believed he could simply influence via the Israeli lobby politicians and the US public against Bush's wishes, but Bush's approval rating was too high, and eventually all parties agreed to convene in Madrid.
  - Feelings internationally were hopeful from this, with two successful bilateral agreements following this, namely the Oslo I Accords, and the Israeli-Jordanian negotiations after.

  - Fatah, the Palestinians present at the negotiations, accepted the accords, but Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), all objected to the accords.
  - Israelis were nervous that this peace process would simply be a part of the PLO's Ten Point Program, which essentially calls for escalating steps until all of historic Palestine is liberated from Israel.
  - Palestinians feared that Israel was not serious about dismantling their settlements in the West Bank, especially around Jerusalem.
  - The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
